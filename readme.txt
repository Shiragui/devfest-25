This project was created at DevFest 2025 February 8-9, at an annual hackathon at Columbia University. 

The inspiration for Lettuce Decide! came from the challenge of deciding on a restaurant that satisfies everyone's needs and cravings in a group. With diverse preferences and dietary restrictions, it can be hard to agree on a place to eat. We wanted to create an app that simplifies this process, letting users easily make decisions together based on their location, preferences, and health considerations.

You can test this app at this link: https://lettucedecide.streamlit.app
